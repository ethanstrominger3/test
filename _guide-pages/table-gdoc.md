Here is a table

| Animal | What I like about the animal | Age |
| ------ | ---------------------------- | --- |
| Dog | They are man's best friend and great for taking on walks.They are totally accepting | 15 |
| Cat | Meoww!  Need I say more?  Is there any animal with more videos? | 12 |
| Elephant | You know that elephants have tusks but did you know they are dangerous?  In Nepal there are more deaths from elephants than any other animal.  It is against the law to kill an elephant even if it has killed multiple people. | 40 |


Text in a one cell table will be treated as a code block

| if (x = 3) {  print('You are right'} |
